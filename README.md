# Overview

This project is an example of a hangman game created with C++. There are many other ways that this game could be written, this is just an interpretation. The object of the game is to guess what the hidden word is before your tries run out. Correctly guessed letters show up in the spaces provided, and incorrect letters are shown above.

This project was created to become more familiar with C++. It started out as a calculator app, but that was a little too easy. The hangman app has more components and greater use of functions than the previous attempt at a calculator.

# Development Environment

This software was written using VS. 

This program is written in C++. C++ is a middle level language, and it was created to be a more amped up version of C. It was first named C with classes, but it was renamed C++ in 1983. The app also uses the iostream library.

# Future Work


- Have part of a person drawn when there is an incorrect guess
- Use classes!
- Have more game options included in the program
